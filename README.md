# Introduction

**DISCLAIMER:**
*This work is in progress, use it carefully at your own risk. Back up yours original configs.*
Don't forget to comment/uncomment the type of your z probe/bl-touch. And recalibrate your printer because this printer.cfg contains my values. Or copy them from yours original cfg, you can find them at the end below "<---SAVE_CONFIG--->" line.

**summary**
What a mess is printer.cfg from Qidi.
So I started some cleanings, modifications, separating to individual files.
Hopefully I fixed bed-nozzle crashing.
Added M600.
